# LookML Diagram

Looker’s LookML Diagram extension provides an entity-relationship-diagram for the objects within your LookML model. With the LookML Diagram developers can:

+ Visualize relationships between LookML objects within an explore
+ Drill into metadata for explores, fields, and joins
+ Simplify the diagram with the option to hide hidden fields or only show fields in joins
+ Refresh the diagram to see the latest LookML

This application requires the “Extension Framework” labs feature be turned on, which can be found in your Admin console. You’ll also want to make sure your users have the appropriate permissions (access_data, develop, see_lookml, see_looks, deploy, explore) to see and use the LookML Diagram. Once installed, the LookML Diagram will be accessible via the “Browse” dropdown on the navigation bar on the top of your screen.


# Data Dictionary

Looker’s Data Dictionary provides a dedicated, centralized interface to search through all your Looker fields and descriptions. There are many reasons to use a Data Dictionary, including:

+ Create a reference source for all consumers of external reports.
+ Provide a location for business users to search all metrics descriptions to identify the appropriate dimension or measure for analysis.
+ Make it easy for external stakeholders to identify and locate the unique metrics for their business.
+ Audit LookML models to assess whether consistent naming conventions are followed, whether there are redundant fields, or if fields are annotated with descriptions.

This application requires the “Extension Framework” labs feature be turned on, which can be found in your Admin console. You’ll also want to make sure your users have the appropriate permissions to see the Data Dictionary.

Once installed, the Data Dictionary will be accessible via the “Browse” dropdown on the navigation bar on the top of your screen.
